# Lab Assignment 4 - Adversarial Attacks Against Machine Learning Based Spam Filters
The learning objective of this lab is for students to gain the first-hand experience on the machine learning based spam filters and related adversarial attacks. Coding experience is recommended, so you might want to work with someone with programming backgrounds. 

## Lab Manual
The lab manual as a notebook file is available at Canvas. You will find textboxes and code blocks to work on for a set of questions and task. You don't need to write a separate report for this lab. Please include all your answers and code in the lab manual for submission. Please explain clearly your ideas and steps as instructed. Remember to save regularly when you are working on the notebook.

The dataset needed for this lab is in this Git folder called messages.csv. 

## Environment Setup

For this lab, you will need to use google colab, and you need a google account to use it. If you have never used google colab or jupyter notebook before, you can go through this tutorial first: https://colab.research.google.com/github/cs231n/cs231n.github.io/blob/master/python-colab.ipynb.

### Use of Google Colab
Open the link https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/. Then just upload the notebook file you download from the Canvas. Then you can work on the notebook file directly.
